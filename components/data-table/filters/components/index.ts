/**
 * Filter Components Module
 * 
 * This module provides a collection of filter components that implement different
 * filtering interfaces for the data table. Each component is designed to handle
 * a specific type of filtering operation and provides a consistent user interface
 * for filtering table data.
 * 
 * Available Components:
 * - SelectFilterComponent: Single-value selection filter
 * - MultiSelectFilterComponent: Multiple-value selection filter
 * - RangeFilterComponent: Numeric range filter
 * - DateRangeFilterComponent: Date range filter
 * - BooleanFilterComponent: True/False filter
 * 
 * Each component is designed to work with TanStack Table's column filtering system
 * and provides a consistent interface for filter state management and user interaction.
